# Typing Commands

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is not stable on replugged. Until [v4.7.0](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged/milestone/10) releases, this will not work using install commands. To make this work, you have to manually install it by cloning & building yourself.

These are commands that are useful for typing & sending messages. Here is an overview of current commands:

| Command | Description | Example |
|:--------|:------------|:-------:|
| alt | Alternates casing of the message | `eXaMpLe MeSsAgE` |
| annoy | Puts spoiler tags for each letter | `||e||||x||||a||||m||||p||||l||||e|||| ||||m||||e||||s||||s||||a||||g||||e||` |
