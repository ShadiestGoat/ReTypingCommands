# Typing Commands

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is not stable on replugged. Until [v4.7.0](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged/milestone/10) releases, this will not work using install commands. To make this work, you have to manually install it by cloning & building yourself.

These are commands that are useful for typing & sending messages.
